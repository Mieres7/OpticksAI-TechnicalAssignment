## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) (to run the containers)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) (to manage the containers)

## Instructions

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mieres7/OpticksAI-TechnicalAssignment.git
cd OpticksAI-TechnicalAssignment
```

### 2. Run the application
